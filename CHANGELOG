0.2.2       Migrated password hashing to use the werkzeug tools, instead of the
            more complex algorithms. this simplifies and speeds up the
            installer, by not requiring the rust compiler for the crypto
            libraries.

0.2.1       Changed CLI stop method to use killpg() instead of kill()

0.2.0       Migrated to SQLAlchemy 2.0 style Mapping for models.
            Fixed model interface delete method, to properly cascade deletes in
            a session.
