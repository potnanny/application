0.5.3       Added user input sanitization to js form elements.

0.5.2       Added autoescape TRUE for templates, for security.

0.5.1       Fix to Action manager

0.5.0       Added Action handler back into code, and fixed keychain forms

0.4.12      Corrected db cleanup function bug

0.4.2       Fixes to Schedule controls, and room graphing

0.4.1       Changes to Bleak scanner (use context mgr rather than stop/start),
            to prevent hanging.
            Added graph hours to settings.

0.4.0       Migrated away from SQLAlchemy, due to performance issues since
            version 2.0. Now using Peewee/Peewee-aio as the ORM.

0.3.1       Removed the models.interface ObjectInterface class, and moved all
            of its functionality into the CRUDMixin class (as classmethods) for
            easier, cleaner functionality. Rewrote all tests using the old
            interface.

0.3.0       Migrated away from aiohttp with a full mithril.js front end, and
            converted to instead use Quart (async flask engine), to make html
            rendering and templating, and CSRF protection, much easier.
            Some mithril.js is still used (for modal forms, mostly), but the
            Jinja template rendering makes many server side decisions easier.

0.2.4       Fixed module reference bug with the worker.WORKER

0.2.3       Fixed mithril/javascript bug, preventing authentication

0.2.2       Migrated password hashing to use the werkzeug tools, instead of the
            more complex algorithms. this simplifies and speeds up the
            installer, by not requiring the rust compiler for the crypto
            libraries.

0.2.1       Changed CLI stop method to use killpg() instead of kill()

0.2.0       Migrated to SQLAlchemy 2.0 style Mapping for models.
            Fixed model interface delete method, to properly cascade deletes in
            a session.
